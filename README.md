# Introduction 
                                            Welcome Team [ ! ]
 This Reason for this Project is for it be used as an  Introduction to the World Of Dev Ops,

 In this project were going to be creating an " Amber " Alert System for Namibia. 

Note:
    this is a dummy Project so feel free to change edit commit, push, pull and merge to your hearts content..
    (those terms will make sense as you go along).

now, while this is just a dummy project that doesnt mean you should make breaking changes just for the sake of it.
POV: 
    1.1 I wana try adding this change to see if my new feature works.
    1.2 I wanna press merge with main to see what effects that will have.
    1.3 I wanna Delete this (please dont if you dont have too) cause its giving me an error.
    1.3.1 If you wanna remove a bit of code cause its causing confilcts, 
        - rather comment it out then delete it till your completely sure its not going to effect anything else.
    1.4 I wanna adit this Method So it also does this.

 => In this project, all of these are fine... please feel free to try out anything you want to here.

 POV: 
    2.1 I wanna delete all of these files just cause 
    2.2 I wanna delete this branch (Not your branch just any ol branch you see)
    2.3 I wanna name my files somthing Provocativ cause thats kinda funny.
    2.4 I wanna name my variabls (Dick, Pussy, Vibrator)... anything of that nature.

  => none of this is ohk, The core function of these rules are to teach you guys about Responsibility , accountability and professional curtisy.

  lets all try to understand these rules and have Fun coding like real Programmers [ ! ]
